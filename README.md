# pyiron DAMASK tensile simulation
This is an example repository of how to run a [DAMASK](https://damask-multiphysics.org/index.html) tensile simulation in pyiron.

In this example we will use pyiron to:
- setup and run a workflow to calculate the stress-strain curve of a material with the continuum code DAMASK.
- we will also show, how to calculate the elastic parameters in pyiron with [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) and use them to run DAMASK simulation.
